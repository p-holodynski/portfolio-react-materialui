# My personal portfolio website
## Built with React and Material-UI

This is my updated portfolio website that I decided to make for learning purposes using React and Material-UI components.

To start your first react app use: [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I have used mostly the official Material-UI documentation: https://material-ui.com/
